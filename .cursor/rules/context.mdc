I'm building an app called **MonkLog** — a simple public habit tracker for founders, creators, and builders in “monk mode”.

It’s not a traditional productivity tool. It’s a public digital battle log that tracks discipline and transformation.

💡 The app should let users:
- Track 5 daily habits (Wake early, No smoke, Train, Build, Sleep 7h)
- Log notes ("Today I trained, built 6h, no cravings")
- See a daily streak count
- Have a public profile (e.g. monklog.app/federico)
- Auto-generate a daily OG image to share on Twitter/X

⚙️ Stack:
- **Next.js App Router**
- **Tailwind + Shadcn UI**
- **Supabase** (DB)
- **Kinde Auth** Auth provider
- **Stripe** (Pro plan: $5/month unlocks squads, analytics, AI assistant)
- **Deployed on Vercel**
- **Upstash Redis** for fast streaks
- **Resend** for email reminders

Start by scaffolding the app structure:
- `app/` folder (App Router)
- Auth with Kinde Auth
- Dashboard to track habits
- Public profile route (`/[username]`)
- OG image route (`/api/og`)
